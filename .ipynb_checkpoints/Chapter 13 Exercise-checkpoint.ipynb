    "**Program Description:** Starting off, the program begins with importing the 'tkinter' module which provides the widgets and objects necessary for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). The class 'AddressGUI' is then defined, this serves to organize and manage the GUI elements of the program, within this class the '__init__' constructor method is made and initializes an instance of the 'AddressGUI' class. Inside of this instance is the main window of the GUI which is created using 'Tk()' managing components from the 'tkinter' module, 'self.main_window.title' also sets the title of this window to \"Name and Address Program\". The two widget frames, top_frame and bottom_frame are created within the main window and these act as their own containers for the widgets stored in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two 'button' widgets are then created inside of the program using 'tkinter.Button', the 'show_info_button' variable is assigned to the 'bottom_frame' and displays the string \"Show Info\" with the command option that performs the execution of the 'information' function when clicked, the associated pack method also displays and arranges the widget to the left of the bottom_frame. The 'quit_button' does the same exact thing apart from the command 'main_window.destroy' which closes out of the GUI when clicked. Additionally a 'StringVar' object named 'description_text' is made with the purpose of holding displayable text in the label widget (this is initialized with an empty string from the .set method), moreover, the 'description_label' label widget is used for the 'top_frame' and is connected to 'description_text'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'pack()' method is called for the 'top_frame' and 'bottom_frame' which is used to display the widgets contained inside of them, this also includes the 'description_label' widged which is packed and displayed in the 'top_frame' container. The function 'tkinter.mainloop() is utilized to create an event loop which allows the program to act as an infinite loop until it is closed using the 'quit_button'. Outside of the instance of 'AddressGUI' the 'information' function is created and modifies the 'description_text' variable with the value from 'description' through the set method (the new value is then displayed when the \"Show Info\" button is clicked."
